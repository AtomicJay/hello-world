# hello-world

Yesterday I joined GitHub because I've been wanting to learn how to code for a long time, and I finally want to get started on it. One of my friends recommended learning Git, so I heeded their recommendation. I also joined GitHub because I'd like to be able to have a place to host my website. The same friend recommended using GitHub pages to do so, which is what I intend to do. I hope this to be the start of a long endeavor that will last a lifetime.
